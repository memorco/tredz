# tredz
tredz code for review

Some of this code is correct, some not and some debatable but I think it will give us a decent amount to discuss. There is no Entity Framework in here but there is Dapper which is a micro ORM based on it. There is also no Redis because I have not used it before. I would like to use it!

The code will build but it is not fully functional because there is no db backing it up. I could have probably gone down a localdb route and added it in but I feel I have spent enough time on this. There are unit tests with moq in here that are worth looking at as well

I hope this gives you what you need :)
